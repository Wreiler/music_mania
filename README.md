The analysis of my playlist from the player, all that i love and listen to in this period of my life

In this project I unloaded all the songs from the playlist in my player, determined the tags and metadata of these songs using the MP3tag application and loaded them into the database with all the necessary columns for further analysis

      I did this as an interesting infographic, which very eloquently reflects my interests in music!
__________________________________________________________________________________

I divided the analysis into the following types of visualization:
- the area chart reflecting the number of songs in the playlist by year of treir release/composition, parameters with slides have also been added here that allow you to conveniently adjust the considered period of time on the chart
- the donut chart the number of songs by their genres and percentage distribution
- the donut chart the number of songs by their release decade and percentage distribution
- the donut chart the number of songs by their runtime and percentage distribution
- list-table to display all data for filtered or non-filtered compositions
- colored list-table which reflects all artists and the number of songs of these artists in the playlist, also was added a parameter with two sorting options for this table - by artist in alphabetical order, in descending order of the number of their compositions


##### These visualisation ideas was compiled and presented on the dashboard
